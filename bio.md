Hobbies:
My most prominent hobby is reading. My favorite genre of books is non-fiction/ historical.  Due to school obligations, I do not get to read as much as I used to.  I have been a voracious reader since childhood.  However, my interests have definitely evolved.  As a child, I preferred fiction/fantasy novels.  Now, I prefer books that will teach me something.

Programming Background:
I had no prior programming experience when I started at OSU. I learned C++ in 161/162.  My favorite programming project so far was the Game of Life assignment for 162.
